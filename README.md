# High Signal

High Signal is **one product**: a synthesized **Daily Brief** assembled from many noisy public sources. It covers three knowledge domains — **technology, startups, finance** — globally by default and filtered to any region a user picks.

The brief has five sections. The first three are public; the last two appear once the user connects a brand.

1. **Stocks watching for a boom** — hit-rate inline on every claim.
2. **Business ideas to build** — surfaced from community demand.
3. **New lifestyle trends** — community + cultural drift.
4. **How the market perceives your products** — mention intelligence.
5. **Ideas to improve your products** — agent-readiness gaps.

Everything else in the repo (Markets, Communities, Mentions, Agent Eval, Lab) is a **lens** — an intelligence helper that feeds the brief. They remain explorable as deep views but are no longer the product's headline.

Pricing: free. No paid tier, no billing. Region is a free filter.

## What it does today
- Ingests SEC filings, IR pages, AI-infra news/blogs, Reddit, GitHub, government feeds, YouTube transcripts, HKEX announcements, GDELT, and prediction markets
- Extracts events + entities + relationships
- Turns world-level changes and repeated app complaints into product opportunities under `/opportunities`
- Maps those opportunities onto the personal product graph under `/personal`
- Drafts daily signal candidates across low / medium / high confidence bands
- Predicts direction + 2nd-order spillover via supplier/customer/peer graph
- Publishes reviewed signal cards + weekly digest
- Auto-backtests every signal — public hit-rate ledger updated continuously

## Why the first market wedge still matters
- Small entity graph (~150 names) — tractable solo
- News-dense, retail-attentive, spillover-dominant alpha pattern (TSMC capex → ASML → HBM → cloud capex → power names)
- Existing incumbents (AlphaSense, Brightwave, Daloopa) own enterprise research workflows; nobody ships a directed spillover graph + public hit-rate
- Source layer is fully covered by OSS — no licensed feeds required for v0

## Status (2026-05-25)

- **Daily Brief** — primary surface at `/` and `/brief`. Worker route `/brief/daily?region=&owner=` composes the five sections from the lenses below. Region filter free for everyone; default global.
- **Markets lens** — functional. Ingest + signal log + review queue + public hit-rate ledger at `/track-record`. Feeds brief section 1 with inline hit-rate per signal type.
- **Communities lens** — functional. Tracked-subreddit CRUD, periodic digest generation (LLM summary when `HIGH_SIGNAL_AI_API_KEY` is set, deterministic fallback otherwise). Feeds brief sections 2 and 3.
- **Mentions lens** — UI + worker wired at `/mentions`. Real LLM checks fail-closed without `HIGH_SIGNAL_AI_API_KEY`; the local preview analyzer panel works regardless. Feeds brief section 4 (per connected brand).
- **Agent Eval lens** — deterministic 8-area evidence scorer + reel briefs at `/agent-eval`. Real-AI prompt execution overlays when the same key is set. Feeds brief section 5 (per connected brand).
- **Cross-source convergence** — `/convergence` page + `GET /convergence?hours=24&min_sources=3` API route. Lists entities hit by ≥ N distinct sources in a rolling window — the strongest pre-news pattern in the system. SQL aggregation against the `events` table; no new ingest. Click an entity to drill into its full entity view.
- **Lab substrate** (plan `0007`) — Phase 1 expanded: docker-compose Postgres+pgvector, schema, HN ingest with outbound-link extraction, one-hop materialization, GitHub trending scraper, 4-factor scorer (HN + recency + velocity + GitHub-momentum placeholder), union-find story clustering, local sentence-transformer embeddings + semantic search, GLiNER entity extraction, local-LLM summarization (Ollama / vLLM), FastAPI feed at `/lab` with cluster-collapse toggle. Still pending from plan 0007: 14k-repo DB import, GitHub API enrichment for repos, GitHub-momentum factor in scorer.

For day-to-day stack and conventions, read `agents.md` (canonical).

## Data pipelines

Status of every public-source ingest that feeds the brief.
**Tick the box when wired.** Items left unticked are either deferred or
partially landed (notes call out *which* part remains).

Legend used in the notes:
- **wired** — ingest runs in the daily cron and writes to D1 / git markdown / artifact.
- **partial** — some of the source's surface is in, but the canonical scope (forms, sub-feeds, sub-tier columns) isn't complete yet.
- **deferred** — wiring exists but not on the daily path (e.g., a v2 of the source).

**Naming convention**: ingest sources live under `python/ingest/src/high_signal_ingest/sources/`; sources that produce a web surface own a route under `apps/web/src/app/`; cron workflows live in `.github/workflows/cron-*.yml`. Each new pipeline gets a row in this list — keep it the canonical status board.

## Will discuss: Signal Studio and playgrounds
**Signal Studio** is the recommended first playground: a visual content lab that turns High Signal findings into polished marketing assets. It should feel like a futuristic marketing command center, not a boring dashboard. It can be playground-quality visually while still producing assets useful for selling High Signal.

Inputs:
- Company URL
- Product positioning
- Competitor names
- High Signal audit findings
- One target buyer persona

Outputs:
- AI visibility audit snapshot
- Competitor comparison page
- LinkedIn carousel
- Short-form reel script
- Landing page teardown
- "Why we lose to competitor X" brief
- Launch announcement
- Weekly founder update

Other playgrounds worth adding:
- **AI SERP Theater** — show simulated buyer-agent searches visually: prompts enter, AI assistants answer, competitors appear/disappear, and citations light up. Strong demo surface for High Signal.
- **Competitor Roast Machine** — enter two SaaS sites and generate a brutal but useful comparison across positioning, trust, AI visibility, homepage clarity, pricing clarity, and content gaps. Fun, shareable, lead-gen friendly.
- **Launch Page Forge** — given a product idea, generate five landing page angles, a pricing page, comparison page, demo script, outbound emails, and social posts. Useful for the fleet and visually attractive.
- **Market Pulse Wall** — a live wall of signals: Reddit complaints, AI search mentions, GitHub trends, news, pricing changes, and founder posts. Potential High Signal "wow" screen.
- **Prompt-to-Campaign** — type a goal like "sell High Signal to devtool founders" and generate the campaign: ICP, message, landing section, posts, cold emails, ad concepts, and demo flow.

Worth folding into core High Signal:
- AI fact-checker / source surfacer
- Hyperlocal/community intelligence
- Market pulse / geo heatmap
- AI visibility / recommendation tracking
- Competitor monitoring

Worth playgrounding as marketing tools:
- Prompt-to-campaign generator
- Competitor roast/comparison machine
- AI SERP theater
- Launch page forge
- Signal-to-reel/carousel generator
- "Put in an idea, get the go/no-go brief"

<!-- ACTIVE-AI-TASK-LOG:START -->
## Active AI Task Log

This section is maintained by the SaaS Maker Active-AI product/design loop so future agents do not reopen duplicate UI tasks.

- Business lane: Core/status context
- Rule: do not create another broad "improve the UI" task unless the acceptance criteria differ materially from the tasks listed here.
- Source of truth for task status: SaaS Maker task board. README entries are durable context only.

- No current Active-AI product/design task from the 2026-05-25/26 loop. Treat this as watch/status unless new evidence appears.
