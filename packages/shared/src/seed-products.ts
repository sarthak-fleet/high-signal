/**
 * Seed-product demo data.
 *
 * Sarthak's 2026-05-25 direction: "30-40 products and 5-7 regions, we can just
 * test those out. No sign up required for now." These products power the
 * Daily Brief's personal sections (4 + 5) when no signed-in brand is
 * available, so the demo always shows what the personalised experience
 * looks like.
 *
 * Each product spans one of the three knowledge domains (technology /
 * startups / finance) and carries:
 *
 * - brandName, brandUrl, region — how the brief addresses the product
 * - perception — section 4 metrics (mention rate, positive sentiment share,
 *   competitor presence) calibrated by hand to be plausible
 * - improvements — section 5 tasks the brief surfaces to "fix"
 *
 * Bias toward boring, recognisable names so users testing the demo can
 * sanity-check the metrics against intuition.
