# Source Coverage And Launch Scope

Status: launch policy
Updated: 2026-05-16

High Signal should generate a useful review queue every day, but it should not
generate random insights. The public product exists to produce decision-grade
signals for an active collection. The rule is:

- Generate drafts broadly inside the active collection.
- Publish selectively.
- Label weak evidence as `low` confidence instead of hiding it.

Every generated insight should answer:

- What changed?
- Who is affected?
- Why does it matter for this collection?
- What direction does it imply?
- What evidence supports it?
- What should a reviewer or reader do next: watch, publish, correct, score, or kill?

## V0 Launch Scope

### Market Intelligence

This is the launch-ready insight product.

Generate daily draft signals from:

- `news` — RSS plus article extraction from seeded AI-infra / semiconductor sources.
- `edgar` — 8-K daily; 10-Q and 10-K on wider windows.
- `ir` — company investor relations and press-release feeds.
- `gov` — export controls, policy, standards, and regulator feeds.
- `gdelt` — broad news backstop and historical replay source.
- `reddit` — public community weak signals.
- `github` — releases and repo activity for AI infrastructure projects.
- `github-archive` — bounded public hourly GitHub Archive reader over already tracked repos.
- `youtube` — transcripts from selected technical / market channels.
- `bluesky` — optional-auth AT Protocol search lane; weak-signal social context only.
- `hkex` — HK-listed AI and semiconductor announcements.
- `markets` — prediction-market quotes; these are resources for context and scoring, not primary signal cards.
- `cisa-kev` — known exploited vulnerabilities only; security-risk candidates for mapped infra/devtool entities, not a broad CVE feed.
- `lobsters` — small technical weak-signal source; useful for developer/infrastructure adoption and risk discussion, not a broad social feed.
- `techmeme` — meta-curation/corroboration source for mainstream tech/business stories; useful when a weak or primary event has crossed into broader attention.
- `substack` — curated writer RSS weak-signal pool; useful for developer/startup narrative shifts, not auto-publish alone.
- `packages` — curated npm/PyPI release and OSV advisory events tied to tracked developer tools and AI packages.
- `jobs` — curated Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby job-board events as leading startup capital and product-focus indicators.
- `huggingface` — public Hub model/dataset activity; useful for ecosystem adoption and model-distribution drift.
- `nvd` — curated NVD CVE queries for tracked security/devtool products; lower priority than CISA KEV unless corroborated.
- `guardian` — optional-key mainstream news corroboration lane; skipped when `GUARDIAN_API_KEY` is absent.
- `patents` — curated USPTO PatentsView grants for long-horizon product-lookahead evidence; adapter is wired, but the live API currently returns the USPTO ODP transition page.
- `gov-contracts` — SBIR public awards plus optional-key SAM.gov opportunity search for federal demand signals.
- `wikidata` — explicit enrichment/audit source, not included in the daily `--source all` signal run; improves mapping and candidate promotion, not public signal volume.
- `semantic-scholar` — curated recent research-paper search; useful for technical trend corroboration and early research weak signals.
- `regulations` — optional-key Regulations.gov document search for dockets and comment windows after a Federal Register notice.
- `companies-house` — explicit UK company enrichment source, not included in the daily `--source all` signal run.
- `metaculus` — optional-auth forecast context; never primary evidence and subject to Metaculus terms before broader/commercial use.
- `podcast-index` — optional-auth podcast metadata lane; transcription is downstream, not daily fetching.
- `macro-rates` — ECB FX and optional-key FRED risk-free-rate context; explicitly not an equity-price source.
- `sec-xbrl` — SEC companyfacts fundamentals for tracked public tickers; market-cap joins must use the equities snapshot source of truth.

### Source Role Policy

Every source must have a role before it is added. More data is not useful unless
it improves candidate discovery, corroboration, entity mapping, or an explicit
lens.

- **Primary evidence** — official filings, IR pages, government catalogs, patents, vendor advisories, GitHub releases, and other sources that can anchor a claim.
- **Corroboration** — trusted news, GDELT, Techmeme-style meta-curation, and independent reporting that confirms a primary event is broader than one page.
- **Weak-signal candidates** — Reddit, HN, YouTube transcripts, Substack, prediction markets, and community chatter. These can start review items but should not auto-publish alone.
- **Enrichment** — Wikidata, GLEIF, Wikipedia pageviews, equities snapshots, and other sources that improve mapping, context, or ranking but are rarely a signal by themselves.
- **Lens-specific intelligence** — Wayback/CDX, competitor page diffs, AI answer checks, review sites, and similar product/competitor sources belong to Mention or Agent Eval until their outcome metric is defined.

Add sources in curated batches. A source should be removed or demoted if it
mostly creates unmapped events, duplicate syndication waves, or drafts with no
decision attached.

Default cadence:

- Daily 06:00 UTC: `pipeline --source all --days 1`
- Every 4h: `pipeline --source markets`
- Daily 22:30 UTC: score matured signals
- Manual backfill: `gdelt,edgar` first, then widen only after review quality is stable

Stock scope:

- **Single stock-price ingress**: public equity / ETF / index / crypto EOD prices come from `python/ingest/src/high_signal_ingest/equities_daily.py` via the shared yfinance adapter and are persisted first as `data/equities-snapshot.jsonl`.
- **No second quote fetchers**: new scripts, workflows, web pages, source adapters, and scoring jobs should not call Yahoo, Stooq, Alpha Vantage, Polygon, IEX, Tiingo, or exchange quote APIs directly for stock prices. They should read `data/equities-snapshot.jsonl` or, after the planned DB migration, D1 `closes` / `ticker_snapshot`.
- **Generated bundles are not sources**: `apps/web/src/data/equities-snapshot.json`, `apps/web/src/data/price-context.json`, `apps/web/src/data/market-refreshes.json`, and `workers/api/src/lib/known-tickers.json` are derived caches.
- **Prediction market quotes are not stock quotes**: `market_quotes` is reserved for Polymarket / Manifold / Kalshi probability data and should not be mixed with EOD equity prices.
- Track Indian public markets as the national watch layer.
- Track US/global names and sectors as the international watch layer.
- Keep the first pass high level: direction, confidence, affected names, sector pressure, and watch/ignore guidance.
- Do not expand into deep valuation models, full analyst reports, or exhaustive single-stock research yet.

Product opportunity handoff:

- When a market or world-level change implies a new constraint, buyer urgency, budget shift, regulatory requirement, or workflow breakage, it should feed `/opportunities`.
- The output should say what product might need to be built, who it is for, why now, and what evidence or complaint cluster supports it.

### Mention Intelligence

Generate product data, not public market signals yet.

Ready now:

- Brand configs
- Prompt-based AI mention checks
- Visibility score / badge API
- Dashboard surface

Not launch-ready as unified signals until the outcome metric is defined:

- visibility gain
- citation gain
- competitor share-of-voice delta
- alert resolution

### Community Intelligence

Generate source-linked digests, not public market signals yet.

Community Intelligence should also observe smaller app requirements and common complaints:

- repeated missing features
- common workflow friction
- support or setup complaints
- requests for integrations, control, monitoring, pricing clarity, privacy, or reliability
- repeated "how do I do X" questions that imply an app/tool gap

Ready now:

- Tracked community contract
- Reddit summary normalization
- Archive pages
- Dashboard surface

Not launch-ready as unified signals until the outcome metric is defined:

- repeated pain cluster
- post/comment velocity
- manually marked usefulness
- buying-intent conversion

### Security Risk

Generate candidates from CISA KEV only when the vulnerable vendor/product maps
to a tracked entity, a security-sensitive developer ecosystem, or a repeated
cross-source pattern. KEV is authoritative enough to preserve as raw evidence,
but public signal cards still need a clear action and preferably a second
source such as a vendor advisory, GitHub advisory, HN discussion, or credible
security reporting.

## Confidence Policy

## Dynamic Insight Types

The seed taxonomy in `python/ingest/src/high_signal_ingest/seed/signal_types.yaml`
is a starting vocabulary, not a closed list.

Generation should prefer seeded types when they fit because that keeps the
track-record ledger easier to compare over time. When a source event clearly
does not fit the seeded taxonomy, the generator may create a new concise
`snake_case` `signal_type`, but only for a repeatable insight pattern tied to
the active collection.

Examples:

- `pricing_page_change`
- `customer_churn_signal`
- `developer_adoption_spike`
- `credit_facility_update`
- `regulatory_comment_window`

Reviewers should merge noisy one-off types back into an existing type when they
are only wording variants. New types should survive when they represent a
repeatable insight pattern with a distinct source mix, horizon, or outcome
metric.

Do not keep types that are just random observations, generic news labels, or
one-off phrasing.

## Kill Criteria

Delete or ignore a draft when:

- It is generic market commentary with no entity-specific catalyst.
- It is off-collection.
- It is only a duplicate syndication wave.
- It has no plausible action beyond "interesting."
- The dynamic type is just a wording variant of an existing type.
- The evidence does not support the direction or confidence.

### Low Confidence

Use for single-source, weak-source, rumor, or early uncorroborated clues.

Low-confidence drafts are allowed and expected. They keep the review queue from
going dark and make weak signals visible. They should not be auto-published
unless the source itself is authoritative or the review note explains why the
single-source item matters.

### Medium Confidence

Use for two corroborating sources without an official primary source.

Medium-confidence drafts are publishable after review if the evidence is not
duplicative and the entity-specific catalyst is clear.

### High Confidence

Use for an official source plus corroborating coverage.

Examples:

- SEC / HKEX filing plus tier-1 coverage
- Company IR release plus credible industry reporting
- Government rule text plus company-specific impact coverage

## Source Credit Policy

Every signal needs visible evidence credit:

- Drafts may have one source if confidence is `low`.
- Published medium/high signals need at least two distinct evidence URLs.
- Evidence URLs should point to the primary source where possible, not only a syndication copy.
- Backfilled signals must keep the historical source date as `published_at`.
- Corrections are new signals; do not rewrite published history.

## What Is Not Ready

Do not expand launch positioning around these yet:

- paid / licensed transcripts
- internal customer documents
- CRM / pipeline data
- broad Indian markets
- mobile or Slack/Discord alerts
- generalized multi-wedge market intelligence
- deep single-stock research before the high-level national/international watch layer works

These can wait until the AI-infra market collection has a stable daily review
queue and enough scored outcomes to make the track record meaningful.

## Readiness Call

High Signal is ready to position as:

> Daily evidence-backed AI-infra market signals, with confidence bands, source
> credit, spillover maps, and a public hit-rate ledger.

For product builders, High Signal should also be ready to position as:

> Put in an idea; High Signal checks it against market, community, mention, news,
> and resource flow, then tells you whether to pursue, test, watch, or avoid.

It is not yet ready to position as:

> A universal intelligence platform across all companies, communities, and
> customer data.
