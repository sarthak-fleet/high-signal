# high-signal/python/ingest

Python ingestion + scoring runtime. Source adapters, entity/relation extraction,
signal generation, audit push.

## Setup

```bash
cd python/ingest
uv sync
```

Models (GLiNER NER, FinBERT) are downloaded on first run. The `markets` source
needs `yfinance`; `edgar` needs `SEC_USER_AGENT="<name> <email>"`.

## Environment

| Var              | Purpose                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AI_BASE_URL`    | OpenAI-compatible base URL for the signal generator LLM.                 |
| `AI_API_KEY`     | API key for the above.                                                   |
| `AI_MODEL`       | Model name (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`).                                         |
| `SEC_USER_AGENT` | Required by EDGAR. Format: `"Sarthak Agrawal sarthak@example.com"`.       |
| `API_BASE`       | Optional. Base URL of the high-signal API. If unset, audit pushes no-op. |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN`    | Optional. Bearer token for `/admin/*` audit endpoints.                   |

The Modal Secret `high-signal` should hold all of the above.

## Layout

```
src/high_signal_ingest/
  sources/        edgar, news, reddit, ir, github, gov, youtube, gdelt, hkex, markets
  extract/        entities.py (primary entity from text), relation extractors
  score/          finbert sentiment, backtest helpers
  seed/           ai_infra_entities.csv, relationships.csv (load_entities())
  audit.py        Best-effort POST to /admin/* — never raises into pipeline
  generator.py    LLM call that drafts a signal candidate
  graph.py        spillover_ids() — hop-decayed BFS over relationships
  pipeline.py     run(source, days) → dict summary
  writer.py       emit() writes signals/YYYY-MM-DD/<slug>.md
modal_app.py      Modal cron entry, deploys daily ingest
tests/            pytest
```

## Run locally

```bash
# Single source, last day's window
uv run python -m high_signal_ingest.pipeline --source news --days 1

# Everything, JSON line output (easy to pipe into jq)
uv run python -m high_signal_ingest.pipeline --source all --days 1 --json

# Preflight: verify env, models, and seed corpus load cleanly
uv run python -m high_signal_ingest.preflight
```

Exit code is `2` when the fetch step errored and produced zero drafted
signals — useful for Modal alerting. Otherwise `0` on success.

## Deploy to Modal

```bash
uv run modal deploy modal_app.py
modal logs high-signal-ingest        # follow the cron
```

## Adding a new source

1. Add `src/high_signal_ingest/sources/<source>.py` exporting either
   `fetch_recent(...) -> list[Event]` or `fetch_all(days: int) -> list[Event]`.
   Use the `Event` shape from `types.py` — populate `source`, `source_url`,
   `published_at`, `title`, `content`, and `primary_entity_id` when known.
2. Wire it into `pipeline.fetch()` behind a new branch and add the literal to
   the `Source` union + the argparse `--source` choices list.
3. Add at least one unit test under `tests/` that pins the response shape
   (use a recorded HTTP fixture; don't hit the live API in CI).
4. If the source needs a new env var, document it here and add it to the
   Modal Secret.

## Audit

Every run pushes to the API:

- `/admin/ingest-runs` — one row per `(source, started_at)` with counts.
- `/admin/events` — raw events keyed by `fetch_run_id` so a single tick is
  replayable.
- `/admin/llm-runs` — token + status for each generator call.

Inspection queries are in `../../docs/ingest-runbook.md`.
